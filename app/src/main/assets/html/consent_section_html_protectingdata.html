        Your privacy is important to us.
        <br/><br/>
        The data collected through the app will be encrypted on the phone.
        <br/><br/>
        We will separate your account information (name, email, contact information, etc.) from
        the study data (the responses to surveys, the mole pictures and the mole measurements).
        The metadata will consist of your responses to survey and mole measurements only. No
        mole pictures will be included in the metadata.
        <br/><br/>
        We will use a random code instead of your name on all study data. This code cannot be
        used to directly re-identify you. Information about the code will be kept in a separate
        secure system. Only key personnel from the study team may connect your study data to
        your name and account information.
        <br/><br/>
        Sancy Leachman, MD. PhD, is leading the study teams for both the Mole Mapper study and
        the War on Melanomaâ„¢ Community Registry.
        <br/><br/>
        The photos you take using Mole Mapper are stored within the app, not on your phone
        photostream or other cloud storage system.
        <br/><br/>
        We will not access your personal phone contacts, other applications, personal photos,
        texts, emails or websites visited.
        <br/><br/>
        Please consult our Privacy Policy for more details.
