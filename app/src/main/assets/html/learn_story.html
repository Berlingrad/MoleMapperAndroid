                Our story
            </h3>

            <p>
                A few years ago, I met and married a woman who means everything to me. She also has
                every risk factor for melanoma, an aggressive and deadly cancer that can result from
                changes in your moles.Â 
            </p>

            <p>
                The earlier you detect melanoma, the better the outcome. And while my wife regularly
                goes to a dermatologist to check her moles, I wanted her to have a tool to map and
                measure them on her own.
            </p>

            <p>
                During my PhD, I studied melanoma biology in the lab and by night worked to create
                the
                app that you have in your hand now. In partnership with OHSU and Sage Bionetworks,
                this
                app can not only help you track your own moles, but now allows you to contribute
                your
                data to a research effort that aims to better understand melanoma risk. I hope Mole
                Mapper makes being vigilant about your health a bit more enjoyable.
            </p>

            <p>
                Happy Mapping,
                </br></br>
