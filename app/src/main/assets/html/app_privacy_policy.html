    Sage Bionetworks Mole Mapper Study</p>
<hr>

<p class="header">Privacy Policy</p>
<p>Effective date: <b>20 Sept 2015</b></p>

<p>Sage Bionetworks (“Sage Bionetworks, “we,” or “us”) is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit
    biomedical research organization in the United States, created to enhance how researchers
    approach the complexity of human biological information and the treatment of disease.</p>

<p>In collaboration with researchers at Oregon Health Science University, we have
    developed a research study (“The Study”) to better understand skin biology and melanoma risks
    using the Mole Mapper mobile application
    <NOBR>(“MM-APP”).</NOBR>
    The Study is designed for users over 18 years of age.
</p>

<p>We respect your privacy. This privacy policy describes our collection of personal
    data when you participate in the Study via the Mole Mapper App, our use and disclosure of such
    personal data, and the steps we take to protect such personal data. “Personal data” means any
    information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person directly or indirectly.</p>

<p>Your use of the Mole Mapper App and your participation in the study are each
    voluntary. By participating in the Study, you consent to the privacy practices described in this
    privacy policy. The entity responsible for the collection and processing of your personal data
    in the context of the Study via the Mole Mapper App is Sage Bionetworks, 1100 Fairview Avenue
    North, Seattle, WA 98109, United States. Its
    representative in Europe is the foundation Sage Bionetworks EU - 271b Noorderakerweg, 1069LT
    Amsterdam, Netherlands.</p>

<p class="header">Registering for the Study through Sage Bionetworks.</p>

<p>In order to participate in the Study, we ask you to create an account through the
    Mole Mapper App. You must affirmatively consent to participate in the Study prior to creating
    your account. We will inform you of the purposes for which we are collecting, processing, using,
    and sharing your personal data and we will obtain your consent through an informed consent
    document and process. To provide your informed consent, you will be asked to provide your first
    and last names, as well as your signature. To create an account after consenting to join the
    Study, you must provide a password and your email address.</p>

<p class="header">Information We Collect</p>

<p>
    In addition to the data we collect in registration for the Study, we collect the following data
    through the Mole Mapper App:
<ul>
    <li>Data Imports. The Mole Mapper App allows you to import data to the Mole Mapper App and the
        Study, including photos of your moles and mole characteristics like location and size. You
        may also give permission to import certain data that you may have provided to Apple Health
        app separately or that may be available through other third party applications. We are not
        responsible for the data practices of third parties from which you may elect to import data
        and you are advised to consult their privacy policies separately. You may choose not to
        import these data types and to still participate in the Study.
    </li>
    <li>Health Surveys. With your permission, we collect and process some personal data that is
        necessary for the purpose of the study. To better understand your evolving health, we will
        ask you to answer questions about yourself (e.g. gender, date of birth, residing zipcode),
        your natural hair/eye color, medical history, and melanoma status). You may choose to leave
        any questions that you do not wish to answer blank.
    </li>
    <li>Standard Log Information. We automatically collect standard server log information, such as
        internet protocol address and details of how you used the Mole Mapper App (e.g. history of
        page requests such as uploading data or signing in and date/time of request).
    </li>
    <li>Other Information You Provide to Us. We also receive other information, including personal
        data that you may provide to us, such as comments or questions you provide to us.
    </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p class="header">How We Use Information</p>

<p>We use your contact information, including email address, to contact you for
    administrative purposes regarding your participation in the Study and your use of the Mole
    Mapper App. We also add your name, contact information and your unique HealthCode to the
    <NOBR>OHSU-managed</NOBR>
    War on Melanoma Community Registry database operated and managed by the Study partner at Oregon
    Health Science University (OHSU)..
</p>

<p>We use the information that we collect through the Mole Mapper App and the Study
    to operate, maintain, enhance and provide all features of the Mole Mapper App and the Study, to
    provide services and information that you request, to respond to comments and questions and
    otherwise to provide support to users.</p>

<p>Your data will be used for improving general health, medical management and for
    the purposes of medical research. Your data will also be used by researchers from the War on
    Melanoma community registry to inform you of other
    <NOBR>melanoma-related</NOBR>
    research opportunities and events that may be of interest to you. Sage Bionetworks isn’t
    involved in the development, maintenance and implementation of the War
    on Melanoma community registry and will not have oversight on communications to or from the
    registry. Sage
    Bionetworks will NOT use your data for commercial advertising. We will not access your personal
    contacts, other applications, personal photos nor text and email messages on your phone.
</p>

<p>With regard to our processing of personal data for the Study, the Mole Mapper App
    and the necessary ancillary services aggregate
    <NOBR>user-provided</NOBR>
    and
    <NOBR>user-generated</NOBR>
    information, including personal data. We separate your account information (e.g., names or email
    address) from your Study data (including survey responses, mole photos and mole characteristics)
    and combine your coded Study data (without your name) with those of other Study participants for
    research and analysis as described below under “How We Disclose Information.”
</p>

<p>We use standard log files and other
    <NOBR>automatically-collected</NOBR>
    usage data that is essential for the Study and the
    <NOBR>MM-APP</NOBR>
    to function effectively, including to: (i) personalize the Mole Mapper App and the Study, such
    as by remembering information so that it does not need to be
    <NOBR>re-entered;</NOBR>
    (ii) monitor and analyze the Mole Mapper App and the Study; (iii) monitor aggregate usage
    metrics; and (iv) track your activities on the Mole Mapper App and in the Study. We do not use
    cookies, beacons or device fingerprinting.
</p>

<p class="header">How We Disclose Information</p>

<p>Except as described in this privacy policy, we will not sell, rent, lease, give
    away, disclose or share your contact information, and will not disclose your information that we
    collect through the Mole Mapper App and the Study to third parties without your consent. We may
    provide contact or coded study information to third parties if you consent to us doing so, as
    well as in the following circumstances:
<ul>
    <li>When we work with third parties who provide services on our behalf, we take steps to limit
        the personal data provided to them to that which is reasonably necessary for them to perform
        their functions for the allowable purposes listed above. We require them by contract to
        agree to only process the personal data in accordance with our instructions and to maintain
        the security and confidentiality of such information by applying adequate technical and
        organizational measures.
    </li>
    <li>To the extent permitted by applicable law, we may disclose your information if required to
        do so by law to comply with state and federal laws, in response to a court order, judicial
        or other government subpoena or warrant, or to otherwise cooperate with law enforcement or
        other governmental agencies.
    </li>
    <li>We also reserve the right to disclose your information that we believe, in good faith, is
        appropriate or necessary to (i) take precautions against liability, (ii) protect ourselves
        or others from fraudulent, abusive, or unlawful uses or activity, (iii) investigate and
        defend ourselves against any
        <NOBR>third-party</NOBR>
        claims or allegations, (iv) protect the security or integrity of the Mole Mapper App and the
        Study and any facilities or equipment used to make the Mole Mapper App or Study available,
        or
        (v) protect our property or other legal rights (including, but not limited to, enforcement
        of
        our agreements), or the rights, property, or safety of others. We will notify you of any
        such
        disclosures.
    </li>
    <li>Information about our users, including personal data, may be disclosed and otherwise
        transferred to an acquirer, successor, or assignee as part of any merger, acquisition, debt
        financing, sale of assets, or similar transaction, or in the event of an insolvency,
        bankruptcy, or receivership in which information is transferred to one or more third parties
        as one of our business assets, to the extent and in the way as prescribed by applicable law.
    </li>
    <li></li>
</ul>

As described above in the “How We Use Information” section, we will combine your Study data with
those of other Study participants. The combined Study data will be transferred to <a
        href="https://www.synapse.org/">Synapse</a>, a computational research
platform, for analysis. Researchers from the Study team and its partners accessing data through
Synapse will analyze the data and report findings back through blog or scientific publications. This
Study gives you the option to share your coded Study data more broadly, with other researchers
worldwide, for use in this research and beyond to benefit future scientific research. If you choose
to share your data broadly, your coded metadata (responses to survey questions and the mole
measurements without the mole photo) will be added to a shared dataset available to qualified
researchers on the Sage Bionetworks Synapse servers (<a href="http://www.synapse.org">www.synapse.org</a>),
and will be made available to qualified researchers who are
registered Synapse users and who agree to using the data in an ethical manner, to do no harm and
not attempt to
<NOBR>re-identify</NOBR>
or
<NOBR>re-contact</NOBR>
you unless you have chosen to allow them to do so. Due to the higher risk of re-identification,
access to the mole photos will require proof of ethics approval for the intended use. The study team
will have no oversight on the future research that qualified researchers who have secured ethics
approval may conduct with the coded study data.
For more information about our data practices in the context of the Synapse research platform, see
the <a
        href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/static.synapse.org/governance/SynapsePrivacyPolicy.pdf?v=4">Synapse
    Privacy Policy</a>.

<p class="header">How is my Health app data handled?</p>

<p>You have the option to share data from your mobile device’s iOS Health app with
    the
    <NOBR>MM-APP.</NOBR>
    Unless you agree to share your data through and with the App, you will not be able to include it
    in the study. Once you agree to share your data through and with the
    <NOBR>MM-APP,</NOBR>
    such data becomes covered by this Privacy Policy. We are not responsible for the data practices
    of the iOS Health app outside the Mole Mapper App in any way.
</p>

<p class="header">Do Not Track</p>

<p>We do not track the Mole Mapper App visitors over time and across third party
    websites or online services to provide targeted advertising, and we do not specifically respond
    to Do Not Track (“DNT”) signals.</p>

<p class="header">Data Security</p>

<p>Sage Bionetworks uses appropriate physical, managerial, and technical safeguards
    that are designed to protect the confidentiality, integrity and security of personal data that
    we collect and maintain against accidental or unlawful loss, theft and misuse and unauthorized
