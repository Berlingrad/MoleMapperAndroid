        Your un-named and coded study data (the answers you provide on surveys and your mole
        data (photos, location, size) will be combined with the similarly de-identified data
        from other study participants.
        <br/><br/>
        By analyzing the data from many Mole Mapper app users we hope to better understand the
        variation in mole growth and cancer risks, and whether a mobile device can help people
        measure moles accurately and manage skin health.
        <br/><br/>
        For example, airline pilots and flight crew are about 2 times more likely to develop
        melanoma. But does this also mean that they have 2 times more moles, or experience more
        dynamic mole changes that can be caught early? Large, combined data sets are necessary
        to answer these types of questions.
        <br/><br/>
        The OHSU study team may query the data to identify and re-contact people with certain
        mole characteristics, and invite them to join specific melanoma-related opportunity or
        events that may be of interest to them through the War on Melanoma Community Registry.
