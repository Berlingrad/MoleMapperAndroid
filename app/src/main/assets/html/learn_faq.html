            This app is designed for self-tracking to help
            you monitor the size, shape, and color of your
            moles. This app does not make any claim to
            detect, diagnose, or treat any skin condition.

            Any data stored within the app is for personal
            use only. We encourage you to share your
            photos and measurements with a licensed
            professional and refer to their professional
            opinion.
