        Researchers from Sage Bionetworks (nonprofit) and OHSU Department of Dermatology invite
        you to participate in a research study about melanoma using Mole Mapper and ResearchStack.
        <br/><br/>
        The aims of this study are to better understand skin biology and melanoma risks and to
        contribute information to the Melanoma Community Registry maintained by OHSU.
        <br/><br/>
        By analyzing the data from many Mole Mapper app users we hope to better understand the
        variation in mole growth and cancer risks, and whether a mobile device can help people
        measure moles accurately and manage their skin health better.
        <br/><br/>
        By answering few questions about yourself, tracking your moles regularly and sharing
        your mole measurements, you can help us learn how melanoma develops and what can be done
        to reduce risks of melanoma.
        <br/><br/>
        If you are over 18 years old, we invite you to join the study and declare war on
        melanoma.
        <br/><br/>
