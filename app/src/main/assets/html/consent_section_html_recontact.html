            The study team may re-contact you. Your name, contact information and your unique
            healthCode
            will be added to the War on Melanoma Community Registry that was created by researchers
            at
            Oregon Health & Science University. The War on Melanoma Community Registry is a
            confidential
            registry for melanoma patients, family members and friends determined to find answers
            and reduce
            deaths caused by melanoma.
            <br/><br/>
            By joining the registry you can help researchers figure out how
            best to prevent, treat and detect melanoma. You will receive information about upcoming
            events
            in your community and get notified about future melanoma education and research
            opportunities.

            <br/><br/>
            <b>WAR ON MELANOMA COMMUNITY REGISTRY</b>
            <br/>
            You are invited to join a registry of
            melanoma patients, their families and friends. The Melanoma Community Registry will
            serve as a
            resource for communicating with you about future melanoma community outreach projects
            and
            research that may be of interest to you. By agreeing to be included in the Melanoma
            Community
            Registry, you are providing consent or permission for OHSU researchers to keep
            information you
            provide to the Melanoma Community Registry in a confidential, privacy-protected, ethics
            board-approved database. You are authorizing them to contact you in the future regarding
            other
            melanoma educational and community events, free skin cancer screenings, and/or skin
            cancer
            research opportunities. Your participation in any of these events is completely
            voluntary and
            you can request removal from the registry at any time.

            <br/><br/>
            <b>HOW MANY PEOPLE WILL TAKE PART IN THIS REGISTRY?</b>
            <br/>
            As many as 100,000 people will take part in this registry, which will be managed by
            Oregon Health & Science University.

            <br/><br/>
            <b>WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I TAKE PART IN THIS RESEARCH REGISTRY?</b>
            <br/>
            The information you choose to provide will help researchers learn about melanoma. The
            amount of information you provide the registry is up to you. In addition to your contact
            information, OHSU may ask you to fill out optional questionnaires and provide other
            information
            about your health. All data included in the Melanoma Community Registry will be stored
            in a
            secure database maintained by OHSU. With your permission, researchers from OHSU may also
            access
            information about you stored in other databases (e.g. data collected through the Mole
            Mapper App
            research collaboration between OHSU and Sage Bionetworks).
            <br/><br/>
            Researchers outside of OHSU mayask the Department of Dermatology to contact you about
            research
            studies they are conducting. In
            this case, OHSU researchers will contact you on their behalf (the researchers will not
            be given
            your contact information unless you directly provide it to them) so that you can decide
            if youâ€™d
            like to participate in that future research. If you decide you do want to participate
            you will
            be given the information necessary to contact the researchers directly. Only studies
            relevant to
            melanoma, approved by an ethics board, and reviewed by the OHSU study team will be
            eligible to
            use this registry for research.
            <br/><br/>
            Before you agree to participate in any future research, the investigator must tell you:
        <ul>
            <li>Why the research is being done, what you will have to do, and how long it will
                last;
            </li>
            <li>The risks and benefits of the research;</li>
            <li>What other choices you have if you prefer not to join the research study; and,</li>
            <li>How information about you will be protected.</li>
        </ul>

        Depending on the study, the investigator may also tell you about:
        <ul>
            <li>What will happen if you are harmed by the study;</li>
            <li>What happens if you decide to stop participating in the study;</li>
            <li>New risks that may be discovered during the study;</li>
            <li>The reason(s) why you may be asked to leave the study before it is completed;</li>
            <li>Costs, if any, you may responsible for; and</li>
            <li>How many people will be in the study.</li>
        </ul>

        <b>HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE REGISTRY?</b>
        <br/>
        Your information will be stored indefinitely, unless you request to be removed from the
        registry.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>WHAT ABOUT COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT?</b>
        <br/>
        Information provided, including any survey responses, photographs,
        videotapes, or audiotapes about you or obtained from you as part of the Melanoma Community
        Registry, may be used for commercial purposes, such as making a discovery that could, in the
        future, be patented or licensed to a company, which could result in a possible financial
        benefit
        to that company, OHSU, and its researchers. There are no plans to pay you if this happens.
        You
        will not have any property rights or ownership or financial interest in or arising from
        products
        or data that may result from your participation in this study. Further, you will have no
        responsibility or liability for any use that may be made of your samples or information.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>WHAT RISKS CAN I EXPECT FROM BEING IN THE REGISTRY?</b>
        <br/>
        We take significant precautions to protect your
        information included in the Melanoma Community Registry. All of the information you provide
        to
        the Melanoma Community Registry is stored at OHSU on a secure, HIPAA-compliant server.
        However,
        there is a small risk of loss of confidentiality. If the information in this registry were
        to be
        accidentally released, it might be possible that the information we will gather about you as
        part of this registry could become available to others.
        <br/><br/>
        If you are injured or harmed while
        participating in the Melanoma Community Registry or while using the cellphone application
        for
        the Mole Mapper Study, you will be treated. OHSU does not offer any financial compensation
        or
        payment for the cost of treatment if you are injured or harmed as a result of participating
        in
        this research. Therefore, any medical treatment you need may be billed to you or your
        insurance.
        However, you are not prevented from seeking to collect compensation for injury related to
        negligence on the part of those involved in the research. Oregon law (Oregon Tort Claims Act
        (ORS 30.260 through 30.300)) may limit the dollar amount that you may recover from OHSU or
        its
        caregivers and researchers for a claim relating to care or research at OHSU, and the time
        you
        have to bring a claim.
        <br/><br/>
        If you have questions on this subject, please call the OHSU Research
        Integrity Office at <a href="tel:+1-503-494-7887">+1-503-494-7887</a>.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART IN THE REGISTRY?</b>
        <br/>
        You may or may not personally benefit from being in this registry. However, by serving as a
        participant, you may help us learn how to benefit patients in the future.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>WHAT OTHER CHOICES DO I HAVE IF I DO NOT TAKE PART IN THIS REGISTRY?</b>
        <br/>
        You may choose not to be in this registry.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>WILL MY INFORMATION BE KEPT PRIVATE?</b>
        <br/>
        We will take steps to keep your personal
        information confidential, but we cannot guarantee total privacy.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>WHAT ARE THE COSTS OF TAKING PART IN THIS REGISTRY?</b>
        <br/>
        There will be no cost to you or your insurance company to participate in
        this registry.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>WHAT ARE MY RIGHTS IF I TAKE PART IN THIS REGISTRY?</b>
        <br/>
        If you have any questions regarding your rights as a research participant, you may contact
        the OHSU Research Integrity
        Office at <a href="tel:+1-503-494-7887">+1-503-494-7887</a>.
        <br/><br/>
        You do not have to join this or any research study. If you do join
        the registry and later change your mind, you have the right to withdraw at any time. This
        includes the right to withdraw your authorization to use and disclose your health
        information.

        <br/><br/>
        <b>WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF I CHOOSE TO STOP PARTICIPATING IN THE REGISTRY?</b>
        <br/>
        You can decide to stop at any time. If, in the future, you decide you no longer want to
        participate in
        this registry, we will delete your information from the Melanoma Community Registry.
        However, if
        your information is already being used in an on-going research project and if its withdrawal
        jeopardizes the success of the entire project, we may continue to use it until the project
        is
        completed.
