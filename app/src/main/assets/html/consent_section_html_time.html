        This study involves answering survey questions and sending mole measurements and photos that
        you
        have taken.<br/><br/>We will send notices on your phone to re-measure your tracked moles
        every month
        and send your updated data along with any information about new moles and whether you had
        any moles
        removed.<br/><br/>The initial survey may take 5-10 minutes, and the follow-up surveys are
        expected
        to take about 1 minute. Measuring a mole may take 1-2 minutes per mole. You can stop and
        restart
        where you left off at any time.<br/><br/>For most people, participating in this study will
        take no
        more than 20 minutes per month. You can adjust your level of participation, as you desire.
        The
        number of moles you track and how often you track you moles is entirely up to you.<br/><br/>Transmitting
        data collected in this study may count against your existing mobile data plan. You may
        configure the
        application to only use WiFi connections to limit the impact this data collection has on
        your data
        plan.
