        <p>This project could create the largest dataset of longitudinal tracking of moles and may
            provide
            insights into the progression of moles to melanoma.<br/><br/>You may or may not
            personally benefit
            from this study. However, using the Mole Mapper app may help you monitor your moles over
            time.
            You will be able to share your mole photos and measurements as you wish, with your
            medical
            doctor and anyone you choose. You will also receive alerts about future melanoma
            educational and
            community events, free skin cancer screenings and/or skin cancer research opportunities
            from the
            War on Melanoma Community Registry.</p>
