            We take great care to protect your information, however there is a slight risk of
            loss of privacy. This risk is low because we separate your account information
            (name, email, contact information, etc.) from the study data. Only key members of
            the study team and some IT staff will have the key to associate your coded study
            data to your name and account information.
            <br/><br/>
            However, certain skin features like tattoos or birthmarks may be unique to you and
            enable your re-identification. So even though your name is kept separate from your
            coded study data, it is possible that someone could still figure out your identity.
            To reduce this risk we recommend photographing moles at close range (6 inches from
            skin surface) to minimize capture of secondary identifiable skin features. Further,
            we will attempt to review and remove from the study dataset all photos that we
            consider identifiable or inappropriate for broad sharing with the research
            community.
            <br/><br/>
            The risk to privacy and confidentiality should be considered before participating in
            the study.
