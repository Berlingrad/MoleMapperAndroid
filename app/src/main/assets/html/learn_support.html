            Technical support for the App
        </h3>

        <p>
            Mole Mapper is a small team effort and the app is in
            active development. We may not respond to every suggestion for improvement, but please
            know your feedback is read and carefully considered. If you find a bug or something
            broken, please let us know. You can email us at <a href="mailto:molemapper@gmail.com">molemapper@gmail.com</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            If you like Mole Mapper, tell a friend or rate us on the App Store. In your review, feel
            free to tell us about your favorite mole name or suggest a clever mole name that we will
            put in to the app for its next release.
