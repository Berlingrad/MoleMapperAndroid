        <p>
            If you join this research study we will ask you to share your mole measurements
            collected using Mole Mapper. You will:
        <ul>
            <li>Take pictures of your moles with the smartphone camera</li>
            <li>Map them to zones on the Mole Mapper body map</li>
            <li>Measure their size relative to a reference object like a coin photographed next
                to the mole.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            We will prompt you to re-measure your moles each month and send your updated data
            along with any information about new moles and whether you had any moles removed. If
            you have had a mole removed in a given month, we will ask you to take a photo and
            measurement of the biopsy site.
            <br/><br/>
            You can track your moles at your convenience, track more or fewer moles or stop
            sharing your mole measurements at any time.
